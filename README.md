a small, beginner level university database using sql
# 🎓 University Database - CaseStudy_4

This is a simple SQL Server database project modeling a university’s core academic operations. I built it purely for practice and learning.

## 🚀 What’s Included

- **Student Table**
  - Stores student info like name, gender, birthdate, and email.
  
- **Professor Table**
  - Professors’ details including email and office numbers.

- **Department Table**
  - Departments linked to their head professors via foreign keys.

- **Classroom Table**
  - Room details like number, capacity, and building.

- **Course Table**
  - Each course’s title, credit hours, and its department.

- **Teaches Table**
  - Maps professors to courses they teach in specific semesters.

- **Enrollment Table**
  - Links students to courses with their grades.

## ⚙️ Features

✅ Relational table design  
✅ Foreign key constraints for data integrity  
✅ Sample data inserts for each table  
✅ ERD design & schema planning

> **Note:** This project is purely for learning and practicing SQL Server database design. It’s not intended for production.

## 💻 Tech Used

- Microsoft SQL Server
- T-SQL (DDL & DML)

## ✅ To-Do

- Add a `courseSchedule` table for defining class schedules.

---

**Next Steps:**
- Expand the database further (e.g. schedules, attendance, more constraints).
- Practice advanced queries and joins using this schema.
